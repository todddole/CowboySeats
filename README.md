# CowboySeats

The scenario: The year is 2050.  The Hardin-Simmons sports teams have so dominated our competition that we are now one of the leading programs in the NCAA.  To accomodate the rising popularity, HSU has built a new stadium/arena with 1 million seats.  Each seat is numbered from 1-1,000,000 and the seats are arranged in a snake order so that each numbered seat is in proximity to the adjacent numbered seats.  

This project will create a seat reservation system.  We will use an implementation of red-black trees to track open/unassigned blocks of seats and assigned blocks, with each block of seats being represented as one node.  For a key, we will use a combination of the block size (in seats) and the starting seat #.

Your job is to implement the red-black tree so that the test passes and the project works.
